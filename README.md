# Data Science Platform

**A starter kit for a data science platform.**

Includes links and descriptions for popular tools, services and resources every
world-class data organization needs in order to manage their data and make data
driven apps and services.

Establishing good data practices early in the organizational transformation is
key. The FAIR data principles are an useful guide to follow.

## FAIR Data

![FAIR](./img/fair.jpg)

FAIR data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and re-usability.

### Elastic Stack

Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the
Elastic Stack. Logstash and Beats facilitate collecting, aggregating, and
enriching your data and storing it in Elasticsearch. Kibana enables you to
interactively explore, visualize, and share insights into your data and manage
and monitor the stack. Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search, and analysis
magic happens.

### Vega

Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving,
and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega, you can describe the
visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a JSON format,
and generate web-based views using Canvas or SVG.
